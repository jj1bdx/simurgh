# Simurgh

A Mode-S "BEAST" TCP decoder server.

* **db branch**: WIP branch to replace
[dump1090-stream-parser](https://github.com/mtigas/dump1090-stream-parser) with
faster go implementation

Mostly an experiment to understand the raw binary "BEAST" signal format,
and an excuse to learn Go. Don't use this for anything real.

## Building / Installation

You need [Go](https://golang.org/). Download & set it up [using the instructions here](https://golang.org/doc/install);
minimally, you need to install the Go tools (and the tools in your `$PATH`)
and ensure that you have a `$GOPATH` set.

Then:

```
go get github.com/mtigas/simurgh
```

Now you'll have a binary at `$GOPATH/bin/simurgh`.

Make sure `$GOPATH/bin` is on your `$PATH`, or copy `$GOPATH/bin/simurgh` to
somewhere like `/usr/local/bin/`.

## Usage

1. You need a `dump1090` server running.

2. Launch the tool by running `simurgh`. There are also some flags
   you can use:

   ```
   -baseLat float
       latitude used for distance calculation (default 40.77725)
   -baseLon float
       longitude for distance calculation (default -73.872611)
   -server string
       ":port" or "ip:port" of the BEAST server to connect to (default "127.0.0.1:30005")
   -sortMode uint
       0: sort by time, 1: sort by distance, 3: sort by air (default 1)
   ```

   i.e. `simurgh --baseLat 40.68931 --baseLon "-74.04464"` if you're
   receiving data from the Statue of Liberty(???)

3. Given that `dump1090` is running on the same machine as this program,

   ```
   simurgh
   # or
   simurgh -server 127.0.0.1:30005
   ```

   will connect to the running dump1090 instance and you should see some basic
   aircraft output, not unlike dump1090’s "interactive mode". Something like:

   ```

   ```

   Output is updated constantly. Aircraft with location data older than 10sec
   are marked with a `?`, and a timer eventually appears. Old aircraft (45sec)
   are discarded from the on-screen list.

   Aircraft where we have received network-assisted
   [multilateration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multilateration)
   (to improve location data) are marked with `^`; this data often comes back
   down [from FlightAware](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multilateration) if
   your dump1090 instance is a "piaware" install that feeds to FlightAware.
